# Image Assets for Photo-Based UI

The following PNG images need to be added to `app/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/`:

1. **bg_menu.png** - Main Menu collage background (from provided artwork)
2. **bg_main.png** - Main Screen collage background (from provided artwork)  
3. **panel_bg.png** - Cream-colored panel for inputs card background (from provided artwork)
4. **bg_splash.png** - Splash screen collage background (from provided artwork)

## Current Status

Placeholder images are currently used (copies of main_bg.jpg). These should be replaced with the actual artwork images referenced in the problem statement.

The panel_bg is currently an XML drawable with a cream-colored solid fill, but should be replaced with the actual panel image from the artwork.

## Note

The .gitignore has been updated to exclude .jpg and .png files from drawable-nodpi to avoid committing large placeholder files.
