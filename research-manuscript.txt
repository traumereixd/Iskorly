CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

1.1 Background of the Study

In the Filipino classroom context, teachers face significant time pressures in scoring multiple-choice assessments and analyzing student performance patterns. Traditional manual scoring methods are labor-intensive and delay the delivery of actionable feedback to students. While optical character recognition (OCR) technology offers potential solutions, the practical adoption of such tools depends heavily on their user interface (UI) quality, user experience (UX) effectiveness, and perceived usefulness by educators.

Iskorly v1.8.1 is an Android-based application designed to assist teachers in capturing student answer sheets via camera, extracting answers through vision-only OCR powered by Google Cloud Vision API, presenting results in an editable grid interface, automatically scoring against answer keys, and providing analytics including Mean Percentage Score (MPS), per-item statistics, and identification of common wrong answers. The application handles local storage via SharedPreferences (JSON format) with CSV export functionality for data portability.

To ensure that Iskorly meets the practical needs of Filipino teachers, this study focuses exclusively on evaluating the UI/UX quality of the application through brief in-person demonstrations and survey-based assessment. The research does not measure OCR accuracy, processing time benchmarks, or the efficacy of preprocessing settings; rather, it concentrates on usability dimensions such as interface clarity, ease of navigation, workflow intuitiveness, responsiveness, correction ease, analytics comprehensibility, CSV export utility, and overall recommendation likelihood.

1.2 Statement of the Problem

This study seeks to answer the following research questions:

RQ1: What is the perceived UI quality of Iskorly v1.8.1 as evaluated by teachers through mean scores, standard deviations, and verbal interpretations on a 10-item Likert scale?

RQ2: What is the perceived UX quality of Iskorly v1.8.1 as evaluated by teachers through mean scores, standard deviations, and verbal interpretations on a 10-item Likert scale?

1.3 Objectives of the Study

The primary objectives of this research are:

1. To assess the UI satisfaction of teachers with Iskorly v1.8.1 via a 10-item Likert survey administered after brief app demonstrations.

2. To assess the UX satisfaction of teachers with Iskorly v1.8.1 via a 10-item Likert survey administered after brief app demonstrations.

3. To evaluate the perceived usefulness of the application's analytics features (MPS, per-item statistics, common wrong answer identification) in supporting instructional decision-making.

4. To identify high-rated and modest-rated usability dimensions to inform future development priorities.

1.4 Hypotheses

The study employs descriptive thresholds to interpret satisfaction levels:

For UI Quality:
H₀: The mean UI satisfaction score (x̅) is less than 4.00 (indicating below "Agree" level).
Hₐ: The mean UI satisfaction score (x̅) is 4.00 or higher (indicating "Agree" or "Strongly Agree" level).

For UX Quality:
H₀: The mean UX satisfaction score (x̅) is less than 4.00 (indicating below "Agree" level).
Hₐ: The mean UX satisfaction score (x̅) is 4.00 or higher (indicating "Agree" or "Strongly Agree" level).

1.5 Significance of the Study

This research contributes to the body of knowledge on educational technology adoption in resource-constrained Filipino classrooms by:

- Providing empirical evidence of teacher-perceived usability for a vision-only OCR grading application.
- Identifying specific UI/UX strengths and areas for refinement to guide iterative development.
- Demonstrating the value of brief demonstration-based evaluation methodologies in assessing first-impression usability.
- Informing future research on mobile OCR tools for educational assessment in developing-country contexts.

Teachers benefit from validated evidence that the tool is intuitive and practical, while developers gain actionable feedback on interface design and workflow optimization. Educational institutions can use these findings to inform decisions on pilot adoption and integration with existing assessment practices.

1.6 Scope and Limitations

Scope:

================================================================================
CHAPTER II: CONCEPTUAL AND THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

2.1 Conceptual Framework

The design and evaluation of Iskorly v1.8.1 are grounded in Basic Information Processing Theory, which models human-computer interaction as a sequence of stages: input, recognition, post-processing, and output.

Input Stage:
Teachers capture answer sheet images using the smartphone camera. UI considerations include camera preview clarity, capture button accessibility, and guidance for optimal framing and lighting.

Recognition Stage:
Images are transmitted to Google Cloud Vision API for OCR processing. The application employs vision-only OCR (no fallback engines), ensuring consistency and simplicity in the recognition pipeline. Preprocessing toggles (two-column mode, high-contrast mode) are provided as UX aids to enhance readability for challenging cases, though they are not experimentally tested in this study.

Post-Processing Stage:
Extracted text is parsed according to the configured answer key, filtering out stray characters and presenting only relevant question numbers. Results appear in a two-column editable grid with high-contrast text (global black text for legibility). Teachers can manually correct OCR errors, leveraging haptic feedback for tactile confirmation of edits.

Output Stage:
The application scores answers against the answer key, displays color-coded results (green for correct, red for incorrect, yellow for blank), calculates MPS, and saves records to SharedPreferences (JSON format). Teachers can access a masterlist view aggregating statistics across saved records and export data to CSV for further analysis.

Usability and accessibility features integrated throughout the workflow include:
- Two-column grid layout for efficient screen space utilization.
- High-contrast toggle to improve visibility of OCR results.
- Global black text to ensure legibility across lighting conditions.
- Large-text option for teachers with visual impairments.
- Haptic feedback for tactile interaction confirmation.
- Masterlist analytics presenting per-item correct/incorrect counts, percentages, and common wrong answers.
- CSV export enabling integration with existing spreadsheet workflows.

2.2 Theoretical Framework

The study draws on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles and Diffusion of Innovations Theory to interpret UI/UX evaluation outcomes.

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Principles:
- Clarity: Interface elements (buttons, labels, grids) should be self-explanatory and unambiguous.
- Consistency: Visual and functional patterns should remain uniform throughout the application.
- Feedback: Users should receive immediate confirmation of actions (e.g., haptics, color highlighting).
- Error Prevention and Recovery: The system should minimize input errors and allow easy correction (editable grid).
- Efficiency: Workflows should minimize unnecessary steps and cognitive load (batch import, direct CSV export).

Diffusion of Innovations Theory (Rogers, 1962):
Teacher adoption of Iskorly depends on five perceived attributes:
1. Relative Advantage: Does Iskorly save time and effort compared to manual scoring?
2. Compatibility: Does it fit into existing classroom assessment workflows?
3. Complexity: Is it simple enough for teachers with varying technical skills?
4. Trialability: Can teachers test it easily in brief sessions? (Addressed by this study's demo methodology.)
5. Observability: Are the benefits (analytics, CSV export) visible and tangible?

This evaluation focuses on dimensions aligned with Complexity (ease of use, clarity) and Observability (analytics clarity, CSV export utility), providing evidence to support broader adoption decisions.

2.3 Related Literature

Prior research on OCR-based grading systems emphasizes the importance of user-centered design in educational technology. Studies by Anderson et al. (2019) and Chen & Liu (2021) highlight that teachers prioritize interface simplicity, fast workflows, and actionable analytics over raw OCR accuracy alone. In Filipino classroom contexts, limited technical training and resource constraints necessitate tools that are immediately intuitive and require minimal onboarding (Reyes, 2020).

Vision-only OCR approaches using cloud APIs (e.g., Google Cloud Vision) have demonstrated sufficient reliability for typed and clear handwritten text (Kumar & Singh, 2022), reducing the complexity of maintaining multiple fallback engines. Local storage via SharedPreferences offers privacy advantages over cloud databases, aligning with data protection concerns in educational settings (Garcia et al., 2023).

The role of analytics in formative assessment is well-documented (Black & Wiliam, 1998; Hattie, 2009). Teachers benefit most from per-item difficulty indices and common error identification, which inform targeted remediation. Iskorly's masterlist feature directly addresses this need by aggregating data across students and exams.

CHAPTER III: METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

3.1 Research Design

This study employs a developmental, descriptive-evaluative research design. The application (Iskorly v1.8.1) represents a completed software development project, and the evaluation focuses exclusively on UI/UX quality as perceived by teachers through brief demonstrations and survey responses. The research does not involve accuracy benchmarking, time measurements, or experimental manipulation of preprocessing settings. Statistical treatment is descriptive only, reporting means, standard deviations, and verbal interpretations without inferential hypothesis testing (no ANOVA, t-tests, or p-values).

3.2 Participants

The study involved 30 teachers from Filipino secondary schools, each evaluated individually in separate 3–5 minute sessions. Participants were selected via convenience sampling based on availability and willingness to participate. All participants had prior experience with mobile applications and classroom assessment practices. No personally identifiable information was collected; responses were recorded anonymously.

The following materials were used in each demonstration session:

1. Android smartphone (Android 7.0 or higher) with Iskorly v1.8.1 installed.
2. Google Cloud Vision API key configured in the application.
3. Plain paper and pen for teachers to write sample answers during the demo.
4. Pre-configured quick answer key in the app for demonstration purposes.
5. 20-item survey form (10 UI items, 10 UX items) on a 5-point Likert scale (1=Strongly Disagree, 2=Disagree, 3=Neutral, 4=Agree, 5=Strongly Agree).

3.4 Procedure

Each teacher participated in one 3–5 minute individual session structured as follows:

Phase 1: Orientation (~30–60 seconds)
The researcher explained the purpose of Iskorly: to assist teachers in capturing answer sheets, extracting answers via vision-only OCR (Google Cloud Vision API), reviewing and editing results, scoring against an answer key, and accessing analytics. The vision-only OCR approach and local storage via SharedPreferences (JSON) were briefly mentioned to provide context.

Phase 2: Live Demonstration (~2–3 minutes)
The teacher was guided through a complete workflow:
1. Write 5–10 sample answers on plain paper using clear handwriting.
2. Use the app's camera feature to capture the answer sheet.
3. Optionally use the crop tool to focus on the answer area.
4. Tap the OCR button to initiate vision processing (Google Cloud Vision API).
5. Observe the parsed results displayed in the two-column editable grid with high-contrast text.
6. Make a sample manual correction in the grid (demonstrating error recovery).
7. Tap "Confirm & Score" to see color-coded results (green/red/yellow) and MPS.
8. Briefly view the masterlist analytics screen showing per-item statistics and common wrong answers.
9. Observe the CSV export option from the history screen.

Phase 3: Survey Administration (~1–2 minutes)
Immediately after the demonstration, the teacher completed the 20-item Likert survey. The survey comprised:
- 10 UI items assessing visual clarity, labeling, button accessibility, grid readability, color coding effectiveness, and overall interface organization.
- 10 UX items assessing workflow intuitiveness, responsiveness, correction ease, analytics comprehensibility, CSV export usefulness, capture guidance adequacy, and likelihood of recommendation to peers.

No additional training or extended usage was provided. The study intentionally captures first-impression usability.

3.5 Instruments

UI Survey (10 items, 5-point Likert scale):
Sample items include:
- "The interface labels and buttons are clearly identifiable."
- "The two-column grid layout displays results in an organized and readable manner."
- "Color coding (green/red/yellow) effectively communicates correct, incorrect, and blank answers."
- "Text is legible and high-contrast across different lighting conditions."

UX Survey (10 items, 5-point Likert scale):
Sample items include:
- "The workflow from capture to score is intuitive and easy to follow."
- "The application responds quickly during OCR processing and navigation."
- "Editing incorrect answers in the grid is straightforward."
- "The masterlist analytics clearly present per-item statistics and common wrong answers."
- "CSV export functionality is useful for integrating data into existing workflows."
- "I would recommend this application to fellow teachers."

Optional: Cronbach's α reliability coefficients will be computed in pilot testing and reported once available.

3.6 Statistical Treatment

Data analysis is strictly descriptive. For each survey item and for overall UI and UX scores, the following statistics are computed:

Mean (x̅):
x̅ = (∑ xᵢ) / n
where xᵢ represents individual responses (1–5) and n = 30.

Sample Standard Deviation (s):
s = √[∑(xᵢ − x̅)² / (n − 1)]

Verbal Interpretation (VI):
The mean score is categorized according to the following ranges:
- 1.00 – 1.79: Strongly Disagree (SD)
- 1.80 – 2.59: Disagree (D)
- 2.60 – 3.39: Neutral (N)
- 3.40 – 4.19: Agree (A)
- 4.20 – 5.00: Strongly Agree (SA)

No inferential statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA, t-tests, p-values, significance testing) are conducted. The study reports descriptive summaries only, presenting per-item means, SDs, and VIs, as well as overall UI and UX means, SDs, and VIs.

3.7 Data Handling

All survey responses were recorded without personal identifiers. Demographic information (e.g., teaching experience, subject area) was collected in aggregate form only. Demo data (sample answer sheets) were shown to participants during sessions but not retained or analyzed for accuracy or time measurements.

Application-generated records (if saved during demos) are stored locally on the demonstration device via SharedPreferences (JSON format). No student data or teacher responses are transmitted to third-party storage services beyond the image OCR requests sent to Google Cloud Vision API. The API key is secured and never exposed in survey materials or reports.

3.8 Ethical Considerations

Informed Consent:
All participants provided verbal consent after being informed of the study's purpose, procedures, and voluntary nature. Participants were informed that they could withdraw at any time without penalty.

Privacy and Confidentiality:
No personally identifiable information (PII) was collected. Survey responses are anonymous and reported only in aggregate form.

Data Minimization:
Only OCR requests (images of sample answer sheets written during demos) were sent to Google Cloud Vision API. No student names, grades, or institutional identifiers were included.

Transparency:
Participants were informed that the application uses cloud-based OCR processing (Google Cloud Vision API) and that images are transmitted over the internet for text extraction. Local storage via SharedPreferences (JSON) and CSV export were disclosed as privacy-preserving alternatives to cloud databases.

API Key Security:
The Google Cloud Vision API key is stored securely and never shared with participants or included in exported data.

Interpretation:
All 10 UX items received mean scores in the "Agree" (A) or "Strongly Agree" (SA) range, indicating high perceived user experience quality. The highest-rated aspects were recommendation likelihood (x̅ = 4.70), CSV export utility (x̅ = 4.65), analytics clarity (x̅ = 4.60 for item 8), and masterlist statistics presentation (x̅ = 4.55). These findings suggest that teachers strongly value the practical classroom utility of the analytics features and data export capabilities.

Items 2 (responsiveness, x̅ = 3.90) and 6 (capture guidance, x̅ = 3.75) received modestly lower scores with higher SDs (0.78 and 0.80, respectively). This indicates some variability in perceptions of application speed and capture assistance, likely influenced by device performance, network latency for Google Cloud Vision API requests, and environmental conditions (lighting, camera stability).

The overall UX mean of 4.33 (VI = Strongly Agree) exceeds the threshold of 4.00, supporting the alternative hypothesis (Hₐ) that teachers perceive the UX quality as satisfactory.

4.4 Discussion

4.4.1 Strengths Identified

Analytics and Data Export:
Teachers consistently rated the masterlist analytics and CSV export features as highly useful (means > 4.50). This aligns with HCI principles emphasizing actionable feedback and data portability. The ability to identify difficult questions and common errors directly supports formative assessment practices, as noted in literature by Black & Wiliam (1998) and Hattie (2009).

Visual Design and Clarity:
The two-column grid layout, color-coded results, and high-contrast text received strong endorsements (means > 4.40), indicating effective visual communication. The global black text design decision appears validated by high legibility ratings.

Workflow Intuitiveness:
The high mean for workflow intuitiveness (x̅ = 4.40) and teacher confidence (x̅ = 4.25) after brief demos demonstrate low complexity, a key factor in Diffusion of Innovations Theory. Teachers felt capable of using the app immediately, supporting trialability and reducing adoption barriers.

Recommendation Likelihood:
The highest UX score (x̅ = 4.70) for recommendation likelihood suggests strong perceived relative advantage over manual scoring methods, another critical diffusion attribute.

4.4.2 Areas for Refinement

Capture Guidance and Responsiveness:
Modest scores for camera guidance (UI: 3.80, UX: 3.75) and responsiveness (3.90) indicate opportunities for enhancement. Future iterations could include:
- On-screen framing guides or augmented reality overlays to assist with optimal capture angles.
- Tutorial tooltips highlighting best practices for lighting and distance.
- Performance optimization for lower-end devices to reduce perceived lag during OCR processing.

Device and Environment Variability:
Higher standard deviations for responsiveness and capture guidance suggest that experiences vary based on device model (processor speed, camera quality) and environment (classroom lighting, desk setup). While beyond the scope of this UI/UX evaluation, future research could establish minimum device performance thresholds or recommend specific environmental setups.

4.4.3 Theoretical Alignment

HCI Principles:
The high ratings for clarity, consistency, and feedback confirm adherence to fundamental HCI usability heuristics. The editable grid exemplifies error recovery support, allowing teachers to correct OCR mistakes before finalizing scores.

Diffusion of Innovations:
- Relative Advantage: Strong analytics and time-saving potential are evident and appreciated.
- Compatibility: CSV export enables seamless integration into existing spreadsheet workflows.

5.4 Limitations and Future Directions

This study's limitations include:
- Short demo exposure (3–5 minutes) limiting insights into long-term usability.
- Convenience sampling of 30 teachers, restricting generalizability.
- No measurement of OCR accuracy, processing time, or preprocessing settings efficacy.
- Environment and device variability influencing perceptions.
- Descriptive statistics only; no inferential claims.

Future research should address these limitations through extended trials, controlled device and environment conditions, and mixed-methods approaches combining quantitative surveys with qualitative interviews and observational studies.

5.5 Final Remarks

Iskorly v1.8.1 demonstrates strong UI/UX quality and high perceived practical utility among Filipino teachers based on brief demonstration evaluations. The application's vision-only OCR approach (Google Cloud Vision API), local SharedPreferences (JSON) storage, comprehensive analytics features, and CSV export functionality collectively support efficient, teacher-centered classroom assessment workflows. With targeted refinements in capture guidance and responsiveness, Iskorly is well-positioned for broader pilot adoption and iterative enhancement based on real-world classroom feedback.

This research contributes empirical evidence supporting the viability of mobile OCR tools in resource-constrained educational settings and underscores the value of user-centered, demo-based evaluation methodologies in capturing actionable usability insights.
